## Guidelines

Please follow the guidelines for pull requests (PRs) in [CONTRIBUTING](/docs/contributing.md). Checklist:

- Ensure that your PR is small, and implements one change
- Give your PR title one of the prefixes ENH, BUG, STYLE, DOC, DEL to indicate what type of change that is (see [CONTRIBUTING](/docs/contributing.md))
- Link the correct GitHub issue for tracking
- Add unit tests for all functions that you introduced or modified
- Run automatic code formatting / linting on all files ("Format Document" Shift-Alt-F in VSCode)
- Ensure that documentation renders correctly in Sphinx by running `make html` in the `docs` folder

## Change the default merge message

When completing your PR, you will be asked for a title and an optional extended description. By default, the extended description will be a concatenation of the individual
commit messages. Please DELETE/REPLACE that with a human readable extended description for non-trivial PRs.
