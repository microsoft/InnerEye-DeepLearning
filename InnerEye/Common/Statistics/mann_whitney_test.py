"""
This script applies several tests, including the Mann-Whitney "U" test, to various kinds of data. There
are three usage patterns, detailed in get_arguments below.

One pattern is, given two or more statistics.csv files produced by AnalyzeDataset (in
https://github.com/microsoft/InnerEye-CreateDataset), for each statistic that occurs in two or more of them,
to calculate several statistics that indicate how different the distributions are between the two files.
A variant on this is to supply only one statistics.csv file but add a dataset.csv that details which institution
each subject comes from. The subjects are then split by institution, just as if they had been in separate
per-institution statistics.csv files. The final pattern is to run on a MetricsAcrossAllRuns.csv produced by
plot_cross_validation.py; the comparisons then are between the Dice scores achieved by different models.

Each statistics.csv input file should have lines of the form

subjectId,statisticName,structure1,structure2,value

Each row of the output will have the following values:

ROC Mann-Wht-p Normal-p I N(I) Mean(I) Std(I) J N(J) Mean(J) Std(J) Statistic

where:

Statistic is the statistic (combination of statisticName, structure1 and structure2) being compared
I and J are the indices (starting from 1) of the two input statistics.csv datasets being compared
N(I), Mean(I) and Std(I) are the count, mean and standard deviation of the statistic value in dataset I
N(J), Mean(J) and Std(J) likewise for dataset J
ROC is the Receiver Operating Characteristic (or AUC, Area Under Curve) statistic for the two sets
   of values, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic; mostly easily understood as
   the probability that if I choose a value v_I from dataset I uniformly at random, and another from v_J,
   then v_I is less than v_J (with ties broken by making a random choice between yes and no). So values
   near to 0.5 indicate similar distributions, while values near 0.0 or 1.0 indicate very different ones.
Mann-Wht-p is the p-value from the Mann-Whitney "U" test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test)
   that the two sets of values come from the same distribution. No assumptions are made about what distribution
   that is, i.e. this is a non-parametric test.
Normal-p is the p-value from the Z test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-test) which assumes the two sets of
   values are normally distributed. Often they are not, so treat with caution. However, this statistic is
   presented because it gives some insight into the significance of any differences between the two
   "Mean" values.

The results are ordered by increasing Mann-Wht-p value, so the most significant results are at the top
of the output. Comparisons are only made when there are at least ten values for the statistic in each
of sets I and J. The distribution with the (apparently) larger values is assigned to J, and other to I.

The "p" values should be interpreted with a suitable correction for the fact that we are testing large
numbers of hypotheses together; see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction. For example,
if you would regard a p value of 0.05 or less as significant for testing a single hypothesis, then when
testing 100 hypotheses, your p value threshold should be 0.05/100.

Also note: when there is an underlying difference between two populations, p values of all kinds
get more extreme (lower) the more samples there are from the populations. But ROC values do not, so once you
accept that the p value is telling you there is a difference, ROC is a better measure of how well separated
the distributions are.

Also note: this script is the one to use when comparing the performance of the SAME model on test data from
two DIFFERENT sources, in order to determine whether the model does better on one test set than the other.
If you want to compare the performance of two DIFFERENT models on the SAME test data, you should use the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test instead (see wilcoxon_signed_rank_test.py), which does pairwise comparisons between scores and is
therefore more powerful than Mann-Whitney. You *could* use the Mann-Whitney test on paired data, but it would
be less powerful than the Wilcoxon test because it does not take advantage of the opportunity to pair the scores.
For example, if one model scored 0.900, 0.910, ..., 0.990 on a set of ten test subjects, and another model scored
0.901, 0.911, ..., 0.991 on the same subjects, then the Mann-Whitney test would not give a very strong result
(the two sets of scores cover very similar distributions) but the Wilcoxon test would show that the second model
is significantly better (it scores higher on each of the ten test subjects, even though only by a little).
