    Downloads a model from AzureML, and starts the score script (usually score.py) in the root folder of the model.
    Downloading the model is only supported if the present code is running inside of AzureML. When running outside
    of AzureML, the model must have been downloaded beforehand into the folder given by the model-folder argument.
    The script is executed with the current Python interpreter.
    If the model requires a specific Conda environment to run in, the caller of this script needs to ensure
    that this has been set up correctly (taking the environment.yml file stored in the model).
    All arguments that are not recognized by the present code will be passed through to `score.py` unmodified.
    Example arguments:
        download_model_and_run_scoring.py --model-id=Foo:1 score.py --foo=1 --bar
    This would attempt to download version 1 of model Foo, and then start the script score.py in the model's root
