Example for the use of SequenceDataset:

A sequence dataset groups rows not only by subject ID (as the normal ClassificationDataset does), but also
by a sequence position. That sequence position is read out from a column specified in the `sequence_column`
field of the model configuration.

Within a given subject, a sequence dataset returns instance of ClassificationItemSequence, each of which contains
a ClassificationItem for each individual sequence position.

Example use case:
subject,POSITION,measure0,measure0,image,Label
1,0,92,362,img1,0
1,1,92,357,img1,1
1,2,92,400,,0
2,0,82,477,img2,0
2,1,82,,img2,1
2,2,82,220,img2,0

To read images and measure1 as a non-imaging feature from this file, you would specify:
    image_channels = []
    image_file_column = "image"
    label_channel = None
    label_value_column = "Label"
    non_image_feature_channels = []
    numerical_columns = ["measure1"]
    sequence_column = "POSITION"

All of the "*_channel" arguments can be left empty. After grouping by subject and sequence position,
only 1 row remains, and it is hence clear to the data loader which row to read from.

After reading the CSV files, the data loader will remove all rows where
* there is no image file path given in the file
* there is a missing value in the non-image features (missing measure1 in the example above)
* If the traverse_dirs_when_loading is given in the model config, the data loader will also remove items where
the image file does not exist.

After this filtering, the data loader will group the items by subject, and sort by position within a subject.
Within a subject, the sequences must start at position 0, and are kept up to the first "gap". Hence, if only positions
0, 1, and 2 are valid, the sequence that is kept contains items [0, 1]

Assuming that the image files all exist, this would return
* result[0] containing "1" with POSITION numbers 0 and 1 (position 2 has no image file)
* result[1] containing "2" with POSITION number 0 only (position 1 has missing measure1, and hence position 2 has to
be dropped as well)
