# InnerEye-DeepLearning

[![Build Status](https://innereye.visualstudio.com/InnerEye/_apis/build/status/InnerEye-DeepLearning/InnerEye-DeepLearning-PR?branchName=main)](https://innereye.visualstudio.com/InnerEye/_build?definitionId=112&branchName=main)

## Overview

This is a deep learning toolbox to train models on medical images (or more generally, 3D images).
It integrates seamlessly with cloud computing in Azure.

On the modelling side, this toolbox supports

- Segmentation models
- Classification and regression models
- Adding cloud support to any PyTorch Lightning model, via a [bring-your-own-model setup](docs/bring_your_own_model.md)

On the user side, this toolbox focusses on enabling machine learning teams to achieve more. It is cloud-first, and
relies on [Azure Machine Learning Services (AzureML)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/machine-learning/) for execution,
bookkeeping, and visualization. Taken together, this gives:

- **Traceability**: AzureML keeps a full record of all experiments that were executed, including a snapshot of
the code. Tags are added to the experiments automatically, that can later help filter and find old experiments.
- **Transparency**: All team members have access to each other's experiments and results.
- **Reproducibility**: Two model training runs using the same code and data will result in exactly the same metrics. All
 sources of randomness like multithreading are controlled for.
- **Cost reduction**: Using AzureML, all compute (virtual machines, VMs) is requested at the time of starting the
training job, and freed up at the end. Idle VMs will not incur costs. In addition, Azure low priority
nodes can be used to further reduce costs (up to 80% cheaper).
- **Scale out**: Large numbers of VMs can be requested easily to cope with a burst in jobs.

Despite the cloud focus, all training and model testing works just as well on local compute, which is important for
model prototyping, debugging, and in cases where the cloud can't be used. In particular, if you already have GPU
machines available, you will be able to utilize them with the InnerEye toolbox.

In addition, our toolbox supports:

- Cross-validation using AzureML's built-in support, where the models for
individual folds are trained in parallel. This is particularly important for the long-running training jobs
often seen with medical images.
- Hyperparameter tuning using
[Hyperdrive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-tune-hyperparameters).
- Building ensemble models.
- Easy creation of new models via a configuration-based approach, and inheritance from an existing
architecture.

Once training in AzureML is done, the models can be deployed from within AzureML.

## Getting started

We recommend using our toolbox with Linux or with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2). Much of the core
functionality works fine on Windows, but PyTorch's full feature set is only available on Linux. Read [more about
WSL here](docs/WSL.md).

Clone the repository into a subfolder of the current directory:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/InnerEye-DeepLearning
cd InnerEye-DeepLearning
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

After that, you need to set up your Python environment:

- Install `conda` or `miniconda` for your operating system.
- Create a Conda environment from the `environment.yml` file in the repository root, and activate it:

```shell
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate InnerEye
```

- If the environment creation fails with odd error messages on a Windows machine, please [continue here](docs/WSL.md).

Now try to run the `HelloWorld` segmentation model - that's a very simple model that will train for 2 epochs on any
machine, no GPU required. You need to set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to point to the repository root first.
Assuming that your current directory is the repository root folder, on Linux `bash` that is:

```shell
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`
python InnerEye/ML/runner.py --model=HelloWorld
```

(Note the "backtick" around the `pwd` command, this is not a standard single quote!)

On Windows:

```shell
set PYTHONPATH=%cd%
python InnerEye/ML/runner.py --model=HelloWorld
```

If that works: Congratulations! You have successfully built your first model using the InnerEye toolbox.

If it fails, please check the
[troubleshooting page on the Wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/InnerEye-DeepLearning/wiki/Issues-with-code-setup-and-the-HelloWorld-model).

## Deployment

We offer a companion set of open-sourced tools that help to integrate trained CT segmentation models with clinical
software systems:

- The [InnerEye-Gateway](https://github.com/microsoft/InnerEye-Gateway) is a Windows service running in a DICOM network,
that can route anonymized DICOM images to an inference service.
- The [InnerEye-Inference](https://github.com/microsoft/InnerEye-Inference) component offers a REST API that integrates
with the InnnEye-Gateway, to run inference on InnerEye-DeepLearning models.

Details can be found [here](docs/deploy_on_aml.md).
